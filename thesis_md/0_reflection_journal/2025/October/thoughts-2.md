## Top of Mind

Since the DBA is a 3-year long journey, I have decided to break in down into smaller phases, each with its own set of goals and milestones. This will help me stay focused and motivated, and will also allow me to celebrate my progress along the way.

### Phase 1: Foundational Coursework and Topic Selection (Months 1-7)
The first phase of my DBA journey will focus on completing the foundational coursework and assignments, as well as selecting a research topic for my thesis. This phase will be crucial in laying the groundwork for my research, and will help me develop the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the later stages of the program.

***Tasks to accomplish in this phase include:***

1. completing the foundational coursework and assignments
2. completing a couple of readings of "Research Methods for Business Students" by Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill
3. identifying 3 potential research topics for my thesis, and conducting preliminary literature reviews on each topic to assess their feasibility and relevance.
4. creating a high-level thesis proposal outline for each topic, including research questions, objectives, and methodologies.
5. narrow down to 1 research topic by the end of this phase, based on feedback from my mentors, colleagues, and peers.

***Milestones:***

1. Completion of foundational coursework and assignments with at least a cummulative score of 50% to meet the eligibility criteria to proceed to the research phase.
2. Selection of a research topic and submission of a high-level thesis proposal outline by the end of month 7.
