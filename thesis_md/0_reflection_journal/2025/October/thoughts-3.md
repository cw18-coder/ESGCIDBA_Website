## Top of Mind

Identifying potential research topics as early as possible will give me ample time to conduct preliminary literature reviews and assess the feasibility and relevance of each topic. This will help me make an informed decision when selecting my final research topic, ensuring that it aligns with my interests, expertise, and the requirements of the DBA program.

Between October and December 2025, I will dedicate time to exploring various research areas that interest me, particularly those that intersect with my professional background in data science and Lean Six Sigma. I will also consider topics that address real-world business challenges, as this will enhance the practical relevance of my research.

I will use 3 main strategies to identify potential research topics:

1. AI assisted open-ended brainstorming sessions using tools like Claude to generate a wide range of ideas based on my interests and expertise.
2. Theory-based exploration by reviewing existing literature and academic journals to identify gaps and emerging trends in my field of interest.
3. Source and read citations in the book "Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments" by Ron Kohavi, Diane Tang and Ya Xu. The reason being that this book is specific to the domain that I currently work in. Besides the citations in the book, I will also source and read publications by Ron Kohavi who is considered a leader in the field of A/B Testing.
