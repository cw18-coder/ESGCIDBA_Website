## Top of Mind

My strategy to conquer the seemingly overwhelming task of successfully completing my DBA thesis will be a multi-faceted approach that combines introspection, meticulous planning, disciplined execution, and continuous learning. Hereâ€™s how I plan to tackle this challenge:

### Understanding my limitations

- Unlike a traditional academic journey, my path is unique. I have a full-time job, family commitments, and other responsibilities that demand my attention. Acknowledging these limitations is the first step in crafting a realistic plan.
- Acknowledging that life and work will intervene, I will need to be flexible and adaptable in my approach. Rather than setting aside large blocks of time for study, I will look for smaller, more manageable windows of opportunity, for example blocks of 30 minutes to an hour. I will try to consistently wake up an hour earlier each day to work on my thesis, and I will also try to dedicate some time during weekends. I will not guilt myself if I miss a day or two, but I will try to make up for it when I can - ***"Consistency over Intensity and Perfection"***.
- I will also seek support from my family, friends, and colleagues. Their encouragement and understanding will be crucial in helping me stay motivated and focused.
- I will not allow other hobbies or interests like fitness, reading, music, and travel to take a backseat. I will try to strike a balance between my academic pursuits and personal interests, as this will help me maintain my mental and emotional well-being.

### Playing to my strengths

- As a seasoned professional with over 20 years of experience working as a Data Scientist and Lean Six Sigma Black Belt, I have a wealth of knowledge and skills that I can leverage in my thesis journey. I will draw on my expertise in data analysis, research methodologies, and project management to ensure that my thesis is of high quality and meets the required standards.
- Additionally, my experience in the corporate world has given me a unique perspective on real-world problems and challenges. I will use this perspective to identify relevant and impactful research topics that align with my interests and expertise.
- Lastly, working on the Copilot Notebook team at Microsoft will provide me with access to cutting-edge technology and resources that I can leverage in my research. I will explore how AI and machine learning can be applied to my research topic, and I will seek guidance from my colleagues, manager, and mentors who have expertise in these areas.

### Adopting Agile Methodologies For Facilitating Time-bound and Iterative Research

- I will adopt Agile methodologies to manage my thesis work effectively. This approach will allow me to break down my research into smaller, manageable tasks and set achievable goals for each phase of the project.
- By using Agile techniques such as sprints and regular check-ins, I can maintain momentum and make continuous progress on my thesis. This will also help me stay flexible and adapt to any changes or challenges that arise during the research process.
- The Agile approach will also support the iterative nature of research, allowing me to refine my hypotheses and methodologies based on ongoing findings and feedback. This is in stark contrast to the linear depictions shown in most thesis guides, which often do not account for the dynamic nature of research.
- I will set clear milestones and deadlines for each phase of my thesis journey. This will help me stay on track and ensure that I am making progress towards my goals.
- I will break down my thesis into smaller, manageable tasks and set achievable goals for each phase of the project. This will help me stay motivated and focused, as I will be able to see tangible progress towards my ultimate goal.
- Adopting Agile is another means of playing to my strengths, as I have experience working in Agile environments in my professional career. I will leverage this experience to ensure that my thesis work is organized, efficient, and effective.

### Leveraging AI as a Force Multiplier
- I will leverage AI tools and technologies to enhance my research capabilities and streamline my workflow.
- I will use AI for collating and organizing literature reviews, identifying relevant research papers, and summarizing key findings. This will save me time and effort, allowing me to focus on analysis and synthesis. This does not mean I will blindly accept AI-generated content, but rather use it as a starting point for my own critical thinking and analysis.
- I will use AI in a way to automate repetitive tasks, such as data collection and analysis, allowing me to focus on higher-level tasks that require critical thinking and creativity.
- I will also explore how AI can be used to generate insights and identify patterns in my data that I may not have otherwise noticed. This will help me to uncover new perspectives and ideas that can inform my research. For example build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) meta analysis system over my journal entries.
- Additionally, I will use AI as a proxy for my thesis supervisor, to provide feedback and guidance on my work. I will use AI tools to review my writing, check for grammar and spelling errors, plagiarism, and provide suggestions for improvement.
- I will use AI to create and maintain the accompanying code repository and website for my thesis, ensuring that it is well-organized, documented, and accessible to others.
- Where feasible and permissible, I will use AI to simulate experiments or run models, allowing me to test hypotheses and validate findings more efficiently, in cases where real-world experimentation is impractical or impossible.

### Learn by Teaching
- I will adopt a "learn by teaching" approach, where I will regularly share my research findings and insights with others. This could be through the accompanying website, blog posts, presentations, or discussions with batchmates, colleagues, and mentors.
- Time permitting, I will organize study groups or discussion forums with fellow DBA candidates to exchange ideas, provide feedback, and support each other throughout the thesis journey.
- By teaching others, I will reinforce my own understanding of the material and identify any gaps in my knowledge. This will also help me to communicate my research effectively and build a network of support and feedback.
- Additionally, sharing my research with others will provide me with valuable feedback and insights that can help me refine my research questions and methodologies.

### Meeting The Foundational Coursework and Assignments
The first 7 months of the DBA program will involve foundational coursework and assignments that will lay the groundwork for my thesis. I will approach this phase with the same level of dedication and discipline as I will for my thesis work, ensuring that I am fully prepared for the research journey ahead. I will also work smart, so that I can balance my coursework with my other responsibilities and commitments. To achieve this I will:

- Prioritize reading the book **"Research Methods for Business Students" by Mark Saunders, Philip Lewis, and Adrian Thornhill**. I learn better from text than videos, and I will take detailed notes and highlight key concepts as I read through the book. This ties in to playing to my strengths.
- Start each course by looking at the assignments and working backwards to identify the key concepts and skills that I need to master in order to complete the assignments successfully.
- Begin drafting my assignment submissions early, allowing ample time for revisions as I re-read the relevant chapters and refine my work.
- Watch the videos as revision at 1.25x or 2x speed, pausing to take notes or re-watch sections as needed.

### Maintaining a Growth Mindset
- I will maintain a growth mindset throughout my thesis journey, recognizing that challenges and setbacks are opportunities for learning and growth.
- I will embrace feedback and criticism, using it as a tool to improve my work and develop my skills.
- I will also celebrate my successes and milestones, recognizing the progress that I have made and the achievements that I have accomplished.
- I will stay curious and open-minded, seeking out new ideas and perspectives that can inform my research.
- I will also prioritize self-care and well-being, recognizing that a healthy mind and body are essential for success in any endeavor.
- I will believe in myself and my abilities, recognizing that I have the skills and knowledge necessary to complete my thesis successfully. I will draw inspiration from my previous work like my Patent, custom algorithms like BRAQUETS etc. These share a common theme of solving real-world problems through innovative solutions, with high levels of uncertainty.
