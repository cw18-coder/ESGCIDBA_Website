                <h2>About This Research</h2>
                <p>
                    This website serves as both a research portfolio and a navigation tool for exploring 
                    the various phases of doctoral research. Each phase represents a critical component 
                    of the research process, building upon previous work to create a comprehensive 
                    scholarly contribution.

                <h3>Research Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    The Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) represents a professional doctorate that 
                    bridges rigorous academic research with practical business application. This work 
                    aims to contribute both to theoretical understanding and to actionable insights for 
                    business practice.
                </p>

                <h3>Research Context</h3>
                <p>
                    My research is grounded in my professional context of enterprise AI and knowledge 
                    management systems. As a Senior Data Scientist on the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/get-started-with-microsoft-365-copilot-notebooks-0775e693-11c6-4d80-8aba-fcc81a737a06" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copilot Notebook</a> product team 
                    at Microsoft, I bring a unique perspective to the intersection of artificial 
                    intelligence, user experience, and organizational knowledge systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/get-started-with-microsoft-365-copilot-notebooks-0775e693-11c6-4d80-8aba-fcc81a737a06" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copilot Notebook</a> represents an enterprise-grade knowledge consolidation platform, 
                    often described as the "For Enterprise" version of Google's <a href="https://notebooklm.google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NotebookLM</a>. It enables 
                    users to consolidate data across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem and external sources 
                    into unified knowledge bases that can be referenced and actioned upon by AI agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role focuses on designing, executing, evaluating, and communicating experimental 
                    results to improve the product through a user-centered approach. This professional 
                    position provides me with unique access to enterprise product data and real-world 
                    user interactions, creating opportunities for empirically grounded research that can 
                    contribute to both theory and practice.
                </p>

                <h3>Academic Institution</h3>
                <p>
                    I am pursuing my Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) through ESGCI (École Supérieure 
                    de Gestion et Commerce International), a prestigious French business school that 
                    specializes in international business education and applied research. ESGCI's DBA 
                    program emphasizes the integration of rigorous academic scholarship with practical 
                    business applications, aligning perfectly with my goal of conducting research that 
                    bridges theoretical understanding and real-world impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program's focus on professional doctorates supports practitioners who seek to 
                    contribute to both academic knowledge and business practice, making it an ideal fit 
                    for research grounded in enterprise technology and data science.
