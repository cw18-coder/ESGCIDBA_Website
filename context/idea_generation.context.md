I work as s Senior Data Scientist in the Copliot Notebook product team at Microsoft.

Think of Copilot Notebook as the "For Enterprise" version of Google's NotebookLM. It allows users to consolidate their data across the M365 ecosystem and external data into a knowledge base which can then be referenced and actioned upon by an agent.

As a product data scientist on the team my primary responsibility will be to design, execute, evaluate and communicate the results of experiments to improve the product by focusing on users.

Given this context, I need your help in identifying potential research topics for my Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) thesis. This is an applied research equivalent of a PhD. While coming up with research topics, please ground them in relevant theoretical frameworks. My preference would be to use a quantitative emperical design, given the access to product user data I will have and my professional background in Data Science.
