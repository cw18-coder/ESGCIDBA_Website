        <h1>Idea Generation Phase</h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The idea generation phase marks the beginning of the doctoral research journey. 
                This phase involves exploring potential research topics, identifying areas of interest, 
                and beginning to shape the research focus through brainstorming and preliminary investigation.

            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
                The approach to idea generation involves:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Broad exploration:</strong> Casting a wide net to consider various business and management topics</li>
                <li><strong>Reflective practice:</strong> Considering personal and professional experiences that might inform research</li>
                <li><strong>Preliminary reading:</strong> Engaging with current literature to understand the state of research</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder consultation:</strong> Discussing ideas with advisors, peers, and industry professionals</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Key Considerations</h2>
            <p>
                When generating and evaluating research ideas, several factors are considered:
            </p>
            
            <h3>Academic Contribution</h3>
            <p>
                Will this research contribute new knowledge or insights to the academic field? 
                Does it address a genuine gap in existing literature?
            </p>
            
            <h3>Practical Relevance</h3>
            <p>
                As a DBA research project, the work should have practical implications for business practice. 
                Will the findings be useful to practitioners, organizations, or policymakers?
            </p>
            
            <h3>Feasibility</h3>
            <p>
                Can this research be completed within the constraints of time, resources, and access? 
                Are the necessary data sources available?
            </p>
            
            <h3>Personal Interest</h3>
            <p>
                Sustaining motivation throughout a multi-year research project requires genuine interest. 
                Does this topic align with personal and professional interests?
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
            <p>
                This phase should result in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A shortlist of 2-3 viable research topics</li>
                <li>Preliminary research questions for each topic</li>
                <li>Initial understanding of existing literature in each area</li>
                <li>Assessment of feasibility and potential contribution</li>
                <li>A clear direction for the proposal phase</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
            <p>
                The ideas developed in this phase will be refined and formalized in the proposal phase, 
                where a specific research question, methodology, and theoretical framework will be developed 
                in detail.
